<h1>Hello Iam bugzen</h1>
<p>The subdomain tequila-api.kiwi.com is vulnerable to subdomain takeover.
An attacker could use this subdomain to host a phishing page, or deliver malicious notifications to users visiting the page. This could be exploited to trick users into disclosing sensitive information such as email addresses, passwords, or other personal data.
Since this subdomain is directly associated with Kiwi.com, any abuse would directly affect Kiwi.com’s users and damage the company’s reputation.
According to the Kiwi.com Bug Bounty program on HackerOne, tequila-api.kiwi.com is listed as in-scope. 
Therefore, this issue qualifies as a Critical Vulnerability, and it has been demonstrated that the subdomain can indeed be taken over.
I hope the Kiwi.com security team will review this report and remediate the issue as soon as possible.
-Thank you</p>
